Lace is an efficient, modern and predictable procedural programming language written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It takes advantage of the compact and write-once-run-anywhere nature of bytecode, while eliminating an entire class of errors by using static typing (a dynamic type is still available, but it's use is discouraged unless required). 
* Easy to debug - Type-safety, null-safety, and prevention of unintended mutations help you write bug free code.
* Blazingly fast - Static-typing and a rust-like GC allows lace to be faster than most interpreted languages.
