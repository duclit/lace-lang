Lace is an efficient, modern and predictable procedural programming language written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

- Easy to write: Lace's syntax is easy to learn and write, saving you development time.


- <code>Speed benchmarks and WASM compiler coming soon.</code>

### Features
Lace features a curly-bracket syntax, with support for structs with functions. (Note that this is _not_ OOP, as it does not support concepts such as inheritance or polymorphism.)
A hello world lace program would look like this:
```rs
writeln!("Hello, world!");
```

### About
Lace's design is inspired by [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).
