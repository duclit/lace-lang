Lace is an efficient, modern and predictable procedural programming language written in [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). It takes advantage of the compact and write-once-run-anywhere nature of bytecode, while eliminating an entire class of errors by using static typing (a dynamic type is still available, but it's use is discouraged unless required).
* Lace is easy to debug - Lace uses static typing and immutable variables (by default) to help you write bug-free code.
* Lace is fast - Static-typing and a JIT compiler (WIP) allows lace to be faster than most interpreted languages.
